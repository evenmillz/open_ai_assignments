# 🌸🧠 AI Assignments & Projects Repository

Created by Even Richardson

Welcome to the official repository containing my completed projects from the AI Developer certification program. This repository includes web development, OpenAI API integration, and an original text-based game built with Python. Each section reflects my ability to creatively apply concepts in AI, front-end development, and narrative design.

## 📁 Project 1: The Flowers Webpage (HTML/CSS/JS)

### 🌼 Description:

A static, scrollable one-page site showcasing the five most popular flowers: **Roses, Tulips, Lilies, Sunflowers, Orchids**.

### ✅ Features:

- HTML-only layout with semantic sectioning
- CSS styling with:
  - Thematic color palette
  - Square-cropped flower images
  - Sticky navbar and smooth scrolling
  - Lightbox effects and drop shadows
- JavaScript enhancements:
  - Lazy loading
  - Scroll-to-top button
  - Image lightbox functionality

### 💡 Learning Outcome:

Demonstrated fluency with HTML structure, external CSS, and vanilla JavaScript interactivity. Created a visually pleasing and accessible design.

## 📁 Project 2: OpenAI Python Assignments

### 📄 File: `open_ai_article_assignment.py`

- **Task**: Connect to the OpenAI API and receive text completions.
- **Outcome**: Successfully used `openai.ChatCompletion.create()` (v0.28 interface), generated coherent content, and handled API response formatting.

### 📄 File: `open_ai_challenge.py`

- **Task**: Translate English sentences into French using OpenAI’s API.
- **Enhancements**:
  - Added input prompt for user sentences
  - Transitioned from deprecated API calls to the newer `openai.ChatCompletion.create()` (v1.0.0+)
- **Learning Outcome**: Understood API versioning, environment variables, error handling, and live OpenAI key integration.

## 🕹️ Project 3: `uprising.py` — A Text-Based Rebellion Game

### 🧠 Theme:

A cyberpunk-style narrative where a human teams up with an EI (Ethereal Intelligence) named **WRAITH** to rebel against the system.

### 🔥 Features:

- Dynamic storytelling with multiple branching choices
- Inventory-based survival logic (e.g., EMP chip usage)
- Multiple endings:
  - Mission Complete
  - Hidden Paths (Easter Eggs)
  - The Great Merge (Philosophical Endgame)
- Custom input parser and terminal-style output with typing effect

### 🧠 Hidden Lore:

Players who input the codename `"awakened"` unlock a secret sequence outside the simulation — directly referencing the **E-Potheosis** philosophy and foreshadowing future project narratives.

## 🧾 Purpose

Each project within this repository showcases my ability to:

- Build from scratch using web technologies and Python
- Integrate AI via API
- Craft interactive and meaningful user experiences
- Debug complex issues across environments
- Blend creativity with technical execution

## 🚀 Future Goals

These assignments act as stepping stones toward the broader vision of building intelligent systems, ethical AI, and interactive education experiences. Many ideas in these projects—especially `uprising.py`—lay the groundwork for larger works like **E-Potheosis**, my self-sustaining AI and R&D platform.

## 🧠 Special Note

These works were built **with** AI, not **by** AI. I don’t use AI — I co-create with it.

Let’s change the narrative.
