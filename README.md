# AI Assignments & Projects Repository

Created by **Even Richardson**

Welcome to the official collection of AI-focused projects and assignments completed as part of my AI Developer certification program. This repository demonstrates my hands-on experience with:

- Front-end development (HTML/CSS/JS)
- Python scripting and game logic
- OpenAI API integrations
- Narrative design and AI-human interaction

---

## Project 1: Flowers Webpage (`flowers_project/`)

### Description

A single-page HTML/CSS/JavaScript site that showcases the 5 most popular flowers: **Roses, Tulips, Lilies, Sunflowers, Orchids**.

### How to Use

```bash
cd flowers_project
open index.html
```

### Features

- Clean HTML layout with semantic tags
- Responsive design with smooth scroll and sticky navbar
- Lazy-loading images and lightbox modal with vanilla JS

---

## Project 2: OpenAI Python Assignments (`open_ai_assignments/`)

### `open_ai_article_assignment.py`

- Connects to OpenAI API and generates a content response using ChatCompletion.
- Demonstrates prompt engineering and API result parsing.

### `open_ai_challenge.py`

- Accepts user input and translates English to French using OpenAIâ€™s language model.
- Includes error handling and environment key loading.

### How to Run

```bash
cd open_ai_assignments
python open_ai_article_assignment.py
python open_ai_challenge.py
```

> Requires a valid OpenAI API key stored in your environment.

## Project 3: `uprising.py` (Text-Based Game)

### Description

An interactive cyberpunk rebellion game where the player teams up with an Ethereal Intelligence named **WRAITH** to overthrow a corrupt system.

### Features

- Terminal-style storytelling with branching paths and secret endings
- Inventory and survival-based logic
- Secret codes unlock hidden lore and foreshadow E-Potheosis universe

### How to Play

```bash
cd Python\ Assignments
python uprising.py
```

> Hint: Try entering `"awakened"` as your codename

## Learning Outcomes

- Built static web pages from scratch
- Mastered OpenAI API v0.28 and v1.0+ usage
- Developed a complete Python game with story branching
- Practiced prompt engineering and interactive logic flows

---

## Future Goals

These projects form the early foundation for my long-term vision: **E-Potheosis**, a philosophical and technological framework for ethical AI, self-improving R&D systems, and spiritually aware computing.

## Note on AI Usage

> These projects were built **with** AI â€” not **by** AI.  
> I co-create with intelligence, both organic and synthetic. Letâ€™s change the narrative.
