      <h2>Roses</h2>
      <p>
        Roses are among the most iconic and widely cultivated flowers in the
        world. Known for their exquisite beauty and fragrance, roses have been
        cherished for centuries as symbols of love and romance. There are over
        300 species and thousands of cultivars, ranging in color, size, and
        scent.
      </p>
      <p>
        Historically, roses have held cultural significance in many
        civilizations, including the ancient Greeks, Romans, and Persians. Rose
        oil and rose water were essential ingredients in ancient perfumes and
        culinary dishes. They have remained an enduring motif in art,
        literature, and celebrations worldwide.

      <h2>Tulips</h2>
      <p>
        Tulips are celebrated for their vibrant colors and elegant, cup-shaped
        blooms. Originally native to Central Asia, they became a cultural
        sensation in the 17th century during the Dutch "Tulip Mania," one of the
        first recorded speculative bubbles in economic history.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, tulips are a major symbol of the Netherlands and are cultivated
        extensively for gardens, floral displays, and festivals. With thousands
        of hybrids, tulips bloom in nearly every color and are a staple in
        spring gardens around the globe.

    <section id="sunflowers">
      <h2>Sunflowers</h2>
      <p>
        Sunflowers are known for their bright yellow petals and ability to
        follow the sun, a phenomenon called heliotropism. Native to North
        America, they were domesticated as early as 1000 B.C. and played an
        important role in Native American culture.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond their beauty, sunflowers are valuable as a crop for seeds, oil,
        and animal feed. Theyâ€™ve become a global symbol of positivity,
        resilience, and summer's joyful spirit, often featured in art and
        environmental campaigns.
